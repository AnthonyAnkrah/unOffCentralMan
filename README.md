unOffCentralMan is a basic CLI tool to help perform some basic ODK Central tasks.

### How does it work?
unOffCentralMan was written with python and as such will require a working instance of a Python 3 environment to function.
It mainly uses the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library and relies heavily on the API documentation for [ODK Central](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#reference)

## How can I use it?
To use the CLI Client, you can use the checklist below.
1. Ensure you have a working instance of Python 3. 
- (*For Windows Users*) You can check this by launching Command prompt (*Windows Key + R*, type **cmd** and hit ENTER) then type `python -V` or `python --version`
- (*For Linux Users*) Launch terminal (*Ctrl + Alt + T*, type **terminal** and hit ENTER) then type `python -V` or `python --version`
- (*For Mac Users*) Launch terminal (*Cmd + Spacebar*, type **terminal** and hit RETURN) then type `python -V` or `python --version`
- If you saw anything other than `Python 3.x.x` displayed after following the most relevant instruction above, then goto the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get it installed.
